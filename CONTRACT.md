Communication:
  We believe that we should check up at a minimum every 3 days. That being said we would like to aim for around 1-2 days instead just so that we are always up to date and know what everyone plans on doing.

Contributions:

  Aidan: Will be in charge of most of the JS. Will also contribute to designing the the cart system in both design and HTML. Will do a small amount of CSS.

  Nathan:
    Will be in charge of most of the HTML on the shopping and cart pages. Will also help design the how the shopping page looks. Will do some CSS as well.

  Enzo:
    Will be in charge of redoing/fixing the HTML in the review page. Will have the greatest portion of CSS. Also might do some of the JS.

  With that, we are all willing to switch around contributions should we ever want/wish to do so.

  Code Review:
    2 of the 3 of us will need to approve the code before the pull request is sent through. It will not take longer than 24 hours to review code. Will try and do it as soon as possible by communicating exactly when code needs to be reviewed.

  Penalties:
    We will start off by nagging and talking out issues should any arise. From there, if the problem still persists then we will send warning email with instructor CC'd. Finally, if nothing changes, we will have a unanimous vote kick trial for them.
