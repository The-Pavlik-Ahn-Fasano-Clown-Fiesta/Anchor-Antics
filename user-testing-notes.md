Round 1:

  Aidans: So from the first round of testing, I have found that this website  requires a lot of scrolling and and the colors seem to be a bit too bright. Furthermore we have decided that for the desktop app, the cart should really be on the right hand side of the screen rather than at the bottom.

  Enzo: Based off the first round of user testing, I believe that we could fix and change a few things. One of which is the holding of user's information in local storage. Another fix could be the review page as a whole. Some of the CSS could be fixed as well, such as the length of scrolling. Finally, I believe that the add to cart button could give a confirmation.
