Round 1:

  Aidans: So from the first round of testing, I have found that this website  requires a lot of scrolling and and the colors seem to be a bit too bright. Furthermore we have decided that for the desktop app, the cart should really be on the right hand side of the screen rather than at the bottom.

  Enzo: Based off the first round of user testing, I believe that we could fix and change a few things. One of which is the holding of user's information in local storage. Another fix could be the review page as a whole. Some of the CSS could be fixed as well, such as the length of scrolling. Finally, I believe that the add to cart button could give a confirmation.

  Nathan:


Round 2:

  Aidan: Some of the things that we noticed from the usability testing, was first, the decimal point should be rounded to the nearest 2 digits to accurately reflect currency. The second things that should be changed in the future is to change of modify the color scheme a little bit. While some users liked the color pallet, some expressed that is was simply too much to look at and made it hard on the eyes. The final thing that needs to be fixed, it would seem that when removing items from the cart, it does not accurately save and report the correct information. Should be a relatively simply fix related to the array used to keep track of what's in the cart.

  Enzo: Based on the most recent usability reports, I believe that a few changes must be implemented in the next stages of the website. Firstly, a few sizing concerns were brought up, either by myself of by the testers. It is only now where I see that perhaps sizing would make the website itself look cleaner. Next, the color scheme could be changed to be a bit easier on the eyes. One tester discussed his appreciation of pastel colors, but on the website it was more than necessary. A smaller, easier detail to fix is that of the rounding of the tax and total cost. A few other changes here and there, but overall those were the 3 main things I found that could be fixed based on the reports.
